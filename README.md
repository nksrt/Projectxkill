Text Summarization through use of Spacy library
Text summarization in NLP means telling a long story in short with a limited number of words and convey an important message in brief.
There can be many strategies to make the large message short and giving the most important information forward, one of them is calculating word frequencies and then normalizing the word frequencies by dividing by the maximum frequency.
After that finding the sentences with high frequencies and taking the most important sentences to convey the message.


Why do we need automatic summarization?

Time optimization, as it takes lesser time to get the gist of the text in summary.
Indexing can be improved with automatic summarization.
More number of documents can be processed if we use automatic summarization.
Bias is lesser in automatic summarization rather than manual ones.



Steps to Text Summarization:

1) Text Cleaning : Removing stop words, punctuation marks and making the words in lower case.

2) Work Tokenization: Tokenize each word from sentences.

3) Word Frequency table: Count the frequency of each word and then divide ethe maximum frequency with each frequency to get the normalized word frequency count.

4) Sentence Tokenization: As per frequency of sentence then 

5) Summarization
